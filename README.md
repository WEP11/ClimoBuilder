# ClimoBuilder
TODO: Bring in the code!
An automated long-term climatology builder I made that will work for any upper air station globally. Yeah, yeah, I know it's in Fortran. But it's also in BASH. And NCL. But the point is that it works! Anybody like Python? I might swap the plotting over to MetPy but I'm taking care of core functionality first. More to come soon!
